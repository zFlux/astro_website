### We Know Simplicity is Good

Software developers so highly value simple and clean code that we
have a multitude of well-loved and oft-repeated acronyms extolling
its virtue: KISS, YAGNI, DRY etc.

I am sure you have heard of at least one.

### Complexity is Still Prevalent

Despite this, software still has a strong pull toward complexity. Code
is often complex, bloated, and messy.
Why? If we know we should be keeping the code simple, why are
we so consistently making it complex?

In my earlier years as a software developer, I used to think that we
just hadn't advocated enough for simplicity. But then every software
professional I've met agrees when I say simplicity is best. After
decades of meeting peers who are all simplicity advocates, it is
hard for me to believe the underlying concept is not universally
accepted, even beloved.

I also thought that maybe we were not being given enough time for
simplicity. Either to pursue it to begin with, or to refactor and simplify
existing code. Again, I've seen too many companies and projects
where we were given plenty of time and budget for refactoring and
cleaning up tech debt. We still ended with complex code, so it likely
is not a lack of resources or time.

### Humans *are* the Complexity

What I have come to believe is that software professionals are
humans, and humans are complex. As much as we may idealize
simplicity in the things we create, we are not simple. We are a
messy pile of spaghetti experiences and our frequently spaghetti-
like code creations reflect ourselves and our complicated nature.

### Software of the people, by the people, for the people

So, what am I saying?

Software development is a human endeavour, for the benefit of
humans, that is most frequently built by teams of humans, who are
managed by humans.

Trust, relationship building, good communication skills, emotional
intelligence and a healthy understanding and respect for human
psychology are essential to doing the job well.
Why do I think this? Because, when I've been on teams that do
these things well, the code we produce is better and *simpler* than
the teams that don't.
