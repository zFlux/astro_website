### We Know Simplicity is Good

The value of simple and clean code is so well thought of amongst software professionals that we have a bunch of
well loved and oft repeated accronyms extoling its virtue: KISS, YAGNI, DRY etc. I'm sure you've heard at least one.

### Complexity is Still Prevalent

In spite of this software still has a strong pull toward complexity. Why? If we know we should be keeping the code 
simple than why are we so consistently making it complex?

In my earlier years as a software developer I used to think that it was that we just hadn't advocated 
enough for simplicity. But then every software professional I've met agrees when I say simplicity is best. 
After decades of meeting peers who are all simplicity advocates it's very hard for me to believe now the message 
isn't universally accepted. 

I've also thought that maybe we weren't being given enough time for simplicity. Either to pursue it to begin with or to refactor 
and simplify existing code. Again, I've seen too many companies and projects where they've given plenty of time 
and budget for refactoring and cleaning up tech debt without that happening so that also isn't it.

### Humans *are* the Complexity

What I've come to is that software professionals are humans and humans are complex. As much as we may idealize 
simplicity in the things we create, we are not simple. We are a messy pile of speghetti experiences 
and our oft speghetti code creations are a reflection of ourselves.

### Software of the people, by the people, for the people

So what am I saying? Software development is a human endeavour for the benefit of humans that is most frequently 
executed by a team of humans that are managed by humans. Trust, relationship building, good communication skills, 
emotional intelligence and a healthy understanding and respect for human psychology are essential to doing the 
job well. Why do I think this? Because when I've been on teams that do these things well the code we produce is 
better and *simpler* than the teams that don't.
