			I build software that helps businesses run smoother, faster, and smarter. Over the years, I’ve partnered with teams in retail, finance, and ed-tech to design web services and data systems that keep complex operations running smoothly.

	At <strong>Canadian Tire</strong> and <strong>Loblaws</strong>, I built real-time supply-chain reporting that kept groceries, auto parts, and apparel moving across Canada — giving teams the visibility and speed they needed to make better decisions, faster.
</p>

<p>
For the <strong>Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan</strong>, I rebuilt their legacy pension management system from the ground up, creating a modern, reliable platform used by 1,300 employees to support and manage the pensions of over 300,000 educators.
</p>

<p>
	At <strong>Thinkific</strong>, I’ve helped shape the platform’s evolution — launching the Thinkific App Store, introducing single sign-on for enterprise partners, building VAT and multi-currency payment systems for international markets, and redesigning the home dashboard and onboarding flow to boost new-creator engagement.
</p>

<p>
	I thrive on complex, customer-focused challenges — the kind that demand both deep technical problem-solving and a sharp understanding of business needs.
