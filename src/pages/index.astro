	At <strong>Canadian Tire</strong> and <strong>Loblaws</strong>, I built real-time supply-chain reporting that kept groceries, auto parts, and apparel moving across Canada — giving teams the visibility and speed they needed to make better decisions, faster.

For the <strong>Ontario Teachers’ Pension Plan</strong>, I rebuilt their legacy pension management system from the ground up, creating a modern, reliable platform used by 1,300 employees to support and manage the pensions of over 300,000 educators.

	At <strong>Thinkific</strong>, I’ve helped shape the platform’s evolution for educators and entrepreneurs — launching the Thinkific App Store, introducing single sign-on for enterprise partners, building VAT and multi-currency payment systems for international markets, and redesigning the home dashboard and onboarding flow to boost new-user engagement.

	I care about thoughtful, durable systems — built on solid engineering practices — the kind that make life easier for the people who rely on them and maintain them.
